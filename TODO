Document current SNMP settings, noting community strings or user configurations.\n29. Save all documentation to a specified folder, ensuring it is backed up and secure.\n30. Review the network diagram to identify existing switches and connections.\n31. Put on an anti-static wrist strap properly grounded before touching equipment.\n32. Power down the existing network switch by unplugging the power cable.\n33. Label each network cable connected to the existing switch for correct reconnections.\n34. Disconnect all network cables from the existing switch carefully.\n35. Unscrew and remove the existing switch from its rack, placing it on an anti-static mat.\n36. Unbox the new network switch and inspect it for physical damage.\n37. Mount the new switch in the rack securely using a screwdriver.\n38. Reconnect network cables to the corresponding ports on the new switch.\n39. Connect the power cable to the new switch and plug it into the outlet.\n40. Power on the new switch by toggling the power switch or pressing the power button.\n41. Verify that power status LEDs are operational according to manufacturer specifications.\n42. Access the switch management interface via console cable and laptop.\n43. Configure the new switch with required settings, such as IP address and VLANs.\n44. Run network diagnostics to ensure the new switch communicates with the network.\n45. Document the physical upgrade process, noting any discrepancies for future reference.\n46. Notify stakeholders that the upgrade is complete and provide test instructions.\n47. Disconnect power cables from existing switches in Rack 01 for labeling.\n48. Install new switches into Rack 01 securely with screws and a screwdriver.\n49. Connect network cables to new switches according to labeled connections.\n50. Plug power cables into the new switches, ensuring correct connections.\n51. Power on the new switches and monitor boot-up sequences via console port.\n52. Access switch management interface through a web browser via default IP and credentials.\n53. Update firmware of new switches using a USB drive and upgrade instructions.\n54. Configure VLANs based on existing network design in the management interface.\n55. Assign IP addresses and network settings to new switches according to documentation.\n56. Enable Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) to prevent network loops.\n57. Implement security protocols by configuring SSH access and disabling unused ports.\n58. Save configuration changes to the running configuration of each switch.\n59. Backup configurations to a network-attached storage device for disaster recovery.\n60. Test connectivity between new switches and rest of the network using ping tests.\n61. Monitor switch logs for errors or warnings, addressing any arising issues.\n62. Connect laptop to the new switch console port with a serial console cable.\n63. Use terminal emulation software to access the switch CLI.\n64. Verify firmware version by entering the command 'show version' in the CLI.\n65. Connect a network cable from the switch to a test VLAN for connectivity confirmation.\n66. Ping the default gateway to verify established connectivity.\n67. Run 'show ip interface brief' to ensure interfaces are up and IP addresses are correct.\n68. Conduct a throughput test using a network testing tool to assess performance metrics.\n69. Check for packet drops via 'show interfaces' command output.\n70. Conduct a VLAN test, sending traffic across configured VLANs and checking behavior.\n71. Review switch system logs using 'show logging' for errors or warnings.\n72. Verify that access control lists (ACLs) are functioning correctly by testing permissions.\n73. Document discrepancies or issues encountered during testing in the change log.\n74. Update network documentation to reflect new switch details and configurations.\n75. Capture traffic data before the upgrade to establish a baseline with a monitoring tool.\n76. Monitor real-time switch performance via serial console cable and terminal emulation software.\n77. Verify switch configuration and software version through 'show version' command.\n78. Set up SNMP monitoring, enabling community strings on the upgraded switch.\n79. Observe key performance indicators (KPIs), including CPU usage and memory utilization.\n80. Examine error logs and notifications for potential issues using 'show logging'.\n81. Adjust Quality of Service (QoS) settings based on traffic analysis.\n82. Schedule regular performance reviews for the first week post-upgrade, documenting findings.\n83. Reassess SNMP settings after two weeks and modify based on performance and security.\n84. Log into the network management system with administrative credentials.\n85. Verify successful upgrade of network switches by checking firmware versions.\n86. Document firmware version and configuration changes in the upgrade log.\n87. Run a network diagnostic test with testing software to ensure connections.\n88. Check ACLs on each switch to confirm they remain unaltered post-upgrade.\n89. Verify that VLAN configurations are intact, comparing to pre-upgrade configuration files.\n90. Update the Network Inventory Database with new switch details and firmware versions.\n91. Notify stakeholders of successful upgrade completion via email or communication tool.\n92. Schedule a follow-up review meeting to discuss upgrade issues and network performance.\n93. Conduct a physical inspection of new switches, ensuring indicator lights function correctly.\n94.
